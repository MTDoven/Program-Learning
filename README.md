# ProgramLearning

This contains some coding tasks and reports that a student from Xidian University needs to complete from freshman to sophomore year. Feel free to use them if needed.  
1. The C language section includes some content from the freshman C language programming course, as well as four separate files with some commonly used functions.
2. The Java section contains project files (source files are in "/project/src/") and several reports.
3. The Python section is not homework content but some notes and tutorials, provided as a resource for students who want to learn Python.
If you have any questions about the code, feel free to raise an issue.
